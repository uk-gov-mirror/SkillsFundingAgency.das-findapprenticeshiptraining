## About

[Find Apprenticeship Training Service](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/). The service is for finding training courses and training providers that can deliver the standard you have searched for. 

## Local running

You must have the Azure Storage emulator running, and in that a table created called `Configuration` in that table add the following:

PartitionKey: LOCAL

RowKey: SFA.DAS.FindApprenticeshipTraining.Web_1.0

Data:
```
{
  "FindApprenticeshipTrainingApi": {
    "Key": "test",
    "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:5003/",
    "PingUrl": "http://localhost:5003/"
  },
  "FindApprenticeshipTrainingWeb": {
    "RedisConnectionString": "",
    "DataProtectionKeysDatabase": "",
    "ZendeskSectionId": "1",
    "ZendeskSnippetKey": "test",
    "ZendeskCoBrowsingSnippetKey": "test"
  }
}

```

The important part of the configuration is making sure that your BaseUrl is pointed to the MockServer url

You are able to run the website by doing the following:
* Run the console app ```SFA.DAS.FAT.MockServer``` - this will create a mock server on http://localhost:5003
* Start the web solution ```SFA.DAS.FAT.Web```
